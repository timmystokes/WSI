# WSI Programming Assignment
## Directions to setup:
First you will need to install the package to run the react dev server:
```
npm install -g react-dev-server
```
Next you will need to install the node packages:
```
npm install
```

## Directions to run the app locally:
In WSI directory, in terminal - run the following:
```
react-dev-server
```
Now you just need to open your chrome browser and go to: 
```
localhost:8080
```

## To run tests:

In WSI directory, in terminal - type the following command:
```
CI=true npm test
```

## Notes about this project:
- I decided to use react.js as my view framework for this assignment, along with bulma as my styling framework, and enzyme for my testing framework. I hope these choices were valid!
- I did not complete end-to-end testing for each component for this assignment but rather I briefly demoed how I would approach testing my components using enzyme - I hope this is acceptable.
